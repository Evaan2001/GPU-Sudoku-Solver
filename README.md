# GPU-Sudoku-Solver
Here's a highly parallelized program (in CUDA) that solved 1,750,000 sudoku boards/sec by applying constraint propagation.

CUDA is Nvidia's parallel computing platform. To run cuda files, you'll need two things –
1) The nvcc compiler, which stands for NVidia Cuda Compiler
2) A NVidia graphics card (I used the NVidia Quadro K1200 GPU)
